*In this article we will explore how the pandemic impacted the tech world, how business is changing and  what are the factors that will cause a post pandemic boom (hopefully)* 

<br/> <br/> 

## Let's start with some stats

<font size=4> The global health crisis definitely changed everything, it freezed some sectors and boosted others, as we are on the verge of entering a post pandemic future, it would be wise to analyse the current situation, some collected numbers will help us have an idea about what the future might look like.

Let's start by the most trivial sector, groceries:

<br/>


1. **Adults picking up groceries at the store before the pandemic: 19.8%**
2. **Adults buying groceries online in march 2021: 24%**
3. **Adults preferring contactless checkout: increased by 34%**
4. **Adults prefering contactless pickup: increased by 18%**

<br/>

Buying groceries is a fundemental activity, it is very difficult to convince people to change their behaviour regarding such basic activity, and yet an increase of online sales of almost 5% was noticed in less than a year. Such change is significant and game changing in a sectore like this one.

It was also recorded that 45% of people said that will continue to buy their groceries online even after the crisis, the behaviour now became a habit. </font>

### Takeaway: Companies must always improve their digital presence providing the best digital experience

<br/>

<font size=4> All of this opens up significant opportunities for retailers in the areas of consumer analytics for marketing, merchandising, supply chain and more. </font>

## Artificial Intelligence, Home Assistants, Chatbots...

<font size=4> Generally speaking people used more technology during the pandemic than ever (43% increase), companies who offer smart solutions (Apple, Amazon and Google), have seen their stock explode. 
<br/>
Google for example have just signed a contract with Walmart to power voice activated shoppping. A smart move that will benefit both, you speak and your groceries arrive at your home. 
<br/>
AI powered chatbots have seen an icncrease during the pandemic too, call centers and many businesses were forced to operate with reduced staff so they had to make robots and automate processes to fill in the gap. 
<br/>
This can be done on the B2B side as well, instead of having a manager looking for answers trough endless data charts and dashboards, companies can implement a smart bot to dig the information directly and provide clear responds. </font>


## Roles of Data Analytics and intelligence

<font size=4>A recent Google-commissioned study by IDG highlighted the role of data analytics and intelligent solutions when it comes to helping businesses separate from their competition. The survey of 2,000 IT leaders across the globe reinforced the notion that the ability to derive insights from data will go a long way towards determining which companies win in this new era.</font>
<br/>
<font size=4>Now a staggering amount of companies (93% according to google) around the world, are either fully digital and smart or have a strategy to do so in the near future, the pandemic played a major role in this reshape, as most of these companies were unaware of the power digitalisation. </font>
