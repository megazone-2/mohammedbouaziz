## What Is Digital Transformation?

<font size=5>
    
The fact that processes are being computerized and digitalized is not something new. 70% of CEOs and business owners were already using technology to pivot their strategies.  

I will define the term Business Digital Transformation: The term business digital transformation is the process that businesses implement to improve themselves, all criteria included, for better market performance in the short term along with longevity and dominance in the long term. *(Mohammed Bouaziz)*

The above definition sounds a bit heavy, that's because digitally transforming your business is a hefty process, it's not something that you can buy and just plug into the company, as the Harvard Business Review puts it. Trying to take a digital transformation strategy and fully integrate it into an ongoing process, is like trying to change the tires of a speeding car, in a car chase. 

Digital Transformation is about fundamentally redefining all business operations, supply chain, and user experience, to make the business overall performance better and establish new stability while staying agile enough to be innovative.

## Business Digital Transformation: Technologies Used

<font size=5>
There is a wide range of technologies that can reshape a company, a lot of these technologies are widely adopted by businesses already:

<br/>

1. Big Data and Data Analytics: big data is mainly the practice of collecting, organizing, and preparing an extremely large data set to be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions. Big data market revenues are projected to increase from $42 billion (2018) to $103 billion by 2027 according to Wikibon; some predictions even suggest a more aggressive trajectory.

2. Artificial Intelligence: the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. Applied to business AI can be disruptive and extremely impactful, impressive tasks like sales forecasting, stock analysis, and prediction along with investment council made upon stochastic markets. Impossible things are being accomplished every day in modern business thanks to AI.

## Keys to successful Business Digital Transformation

<br/>

<font size=5>
Deciding to take the leap and finally bring your business into the digital age, requires multiple shifts and a steady mindset, there are several bad turns that the business manager or business owner must avoid. 

Here are the keys that we believe are necessary to a successful business digital transformation: 

<br/>

1. Strong data-driven Leadership: The effective executive, as peter Drucker puts it, gets the information he needs, asking what needs to be done and taking the question seriously, then gathering all the data mandatory to answer the question the best way possible. The executive must also have a strong eye for finding the parts of the business that needs to be optimized, then he must have the ability that most intellectuals lack, that of putting clear measurable goals. 

2. Business Bravado: Having business bravado means having the ability to take action even when odds are not clear. Now a team of good engineers and developers will be walking with you into the path of digitalization, so no need to panic.

3. Lean and Agile structure: You may have the best digital strategy but if your business is not flexible, the shift towards a digital transformation is gonna be brutal. 

4. Business-driven tech team: The team of engineers and developers that will take care of transforming the company need to have a deep understanding of your business. As tech and business are tightly coupled, the gap must be kept small or problems will arise.
