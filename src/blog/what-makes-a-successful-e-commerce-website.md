Due to the latest lockdowns caused by the pandemic, many businesses were almost obliged to create an online presence with an e-commerce website. 
These companies thought that all it took was to develop the store, host it and customers would come in rushing. 
The old saying: build it and they will come, is not true at all for the web. 
Companies need to build, attract, market, create stunning digital experiences and then watch the sales grow.

## Importance of an e-commerce website:

<font size=5>
As bigcommerce.com puts it:

1. **Newmarket acquisitions:** For many companies, especially small businesses and startups, it can be hard 

to reach customers in new markets with just a storefront. An e-commerce site enables you to reach new 

customers online that you couldn’t reach with only brick-and-mortar sales.

<br/>

2. **Create unique shopping experiences:** Online businesses are also able to directly impact the customer 

journey by creating a unique shopping experience through videos, stories, and personalized services. 

These shopping encounters don’t need to end at the checkout either, as you can reach customers via email 

marketing or social media. These extraordinary experiences have a way of convincing customers that 

online shopping offers inclusive opportunities that a brick-and-mortar store typically doesn’t provide.

<br/>

3. **Strengthen your brand:** If you sell on an online marketplace, like eBay or Amazon, your products are 

listed generically and often use the marketplace’s brandings. Some customers may not even realize 

they’re purchasing from you and consequently won’t learn about your brand. Building your e-commerce site 

ensures control of how your products are presented. Your customers remember you, not the marketplace.

## Architecture and development of the e-commerce website:

<br/>
<font size=5>
Many questions arise here, like: 

1.  Should I hire an engineer and developer ?
2. Should I go for Saas (online e-commerce builder) ?
3. If I choose Saas, which platform should I pick ?
4.  If I choose to hire a developer, which technologies should he choose ?


There are no absolute answers to these questions. 
So, we will answer these, one by one, and give recommendations for each.
<br/>

## Developer vs Saas ?
<br/>
<font size=5>
First of all, let me list all of the e-commerce platforms available on the web: 

**BigCommerce**
BigCommerce is a very scalable platform, It has 24/7 customer support, with priority support available 
for large accounts. There are plenty of built-in features. Multi-layered security keeps data safe, and 
local payment methods bring in customers from around the world. BigCommerce supports headless, so brands 
can deliver API-driven experiences through a CMS, DXP, application, device, or custom front-end — with 
BigCommerce powering the commerce engine.

**Shopify**
Shopify is another SaaS solution that’s fully hosted and known for being quick and easy to set up. They 
have an extensive range of plug-ins, but if you need to use a lot, the price can quickly add up. Shopify 
can handle a high number of transactions per minute, so it can easily cope with traffic spikes. 

**Magento**
Magento is a self-hosted solution, so you have total creative freedom; however, you need someone with 
coding knowledge to take full advantage of the platform. There’s a wide choice of integrations, and it 
can handle instant purchases and product suggestions. 

**WooCommerce**
WooCommerce is an open-source WordPress plug-in, so it’s free to install. It’s generally used by those 
with an existing WordPress site. WooCommerce is flexible, has limitless customization, and industry 
experts audit its security code.

All these offer great service and are scalable but the issue here is that these platforms are not easily 
maintained and therefore not that easy to use. They take time to get familiar and experienced with them, 
so you may need a developer after all.

## The Developer option :
<br/>
<font size=5>
A good developer will cost you money but will make your life a lot easier. The question that needs an answer now is what technology should a developer use. The tech stack a developer will use depends on what criteria's are important to us.<br/>
If the important thing is that the site is highly scalable, I recommend using a technology like Java, Python, or PHP. Java is robust, python is easy to maintain and truly great for data visualization which is a must for e-commerce websites, and PHP has a lot of support and works well with WordPress, a familiar and popular choice to make e-commerce platforms.<br/> 
When development speed and security are the important factors we recommend using Javascript or WordPress. The developer will make the website faster and will be relatively secure.

## Now it's built, how will they come (and why) ?

<font size=5>

Building the platform is just a part of building the business, a company needs to generate sales, here is how we will achieve that:

1. Successful domain name: it all starts with the domain name, it has to be clear, short, not too general, and easy to remember.
2. Killer product description: the product description can make or break an e-commerce platform, so don't technically describe the product but write something that speaks the benefits that the user will enjoy, be human and engaging
3. High-quality images: this one speaks for itself
4. Easy checking mode
5. Solid and certain refund policy

In conclusion, I suggest that you set up a blog and post daily in it, I also suggest that you get a Facebook Ads expert, or a digital marketer to help you position your website out there.
