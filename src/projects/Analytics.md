### The problem :sos: 
<font size="4"> The client called me because he had terabytes of unused, randomly collected data. Management needs to make data driven
decions based on data, not based on opinions. No matter how experienced a manager is, without data, his ideas are just opinions.</font>
<br/><br/>
### Business profit and ROI :dollar:
<font size="4"> Leveraging and analysing data will save the company a lot of money here is how: 
1. Optimization: Data analysis guives a clear vision on where the company is losing money
2. Acquisition: Data analysis tells you where to get new business, or where to sell and to whom
3. Management: Data analysis makes you manage effectively.

The client achieved all these goals in clear mesurable metrics
</font>
<br/><br/>
### The digital solution :chart: 
<font size="4"> The solution here wasn't just to turn data into graphs, the goal was to create a stable system that turns information into knowledge
and decisions by analatical analysis. That means whenver actions within the company occur, data must be generated automatically
transformed into charts and graphs to constitute what we called _The Leadership Dashboard_</font>
<br/><br/>
### How we achieved our goal :tophat:
<font size="4">Our problem solving method unfolds in six calculated steps:

1. Defining the problem : Clear concise speech that describes the problem 
2. Diagnostic : A description of the current situation
3. Set metrics : Metrics and numbers that will define our success
4. Split and divide : Turn the initial problem into small fragments 
5. Solve and Assemble : solve each part individually, put everything together 
6. Test and Compare :  see if the solution fits our metrics
<br/>
The clients problem was "We have a lot of unused data, we need to leverage that data to make more profit and optimize". The first
audit showed that there is no data analysis system, so here we were starting from scratch. Next, we proceeded by collecting data,
cleaning it, storing, passing it trough the mathematical models and finally interpretation by charts and council, all automated.
