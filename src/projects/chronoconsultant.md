### The problem :sos: 
<font size="4"> A friend of mine who worked in a global Management firm, once told me that they had a client who was barely making 
any profit, and yet, had a hefty council contract with that firm. No company would pay that much money for council, unless they had 
a huge need for it. 

The client who called me wanted to build a consulting platform where companies would ask for council and get answers by competent
couselors, it's like a tinder that matches companies and conselors. 

The market is clearly ready for this e-conulting platform, the tricky parts that needed to be managed were:
1. **how would we match cousultants and companies or business owners ?** 
2. **How to handle communications ?** 
3. **How to decide if the client's needs were met ?** 
4. **How to financially compensate counselers ?** 
5. **What is the refund policy ?**

I operate on these projects not just as a software engineer, but also mainely as a product manager. So, it is my duty to answer these
questions, and provide effective, technical, innovative solutions for these business challenges.

### Business profit and ROI :dollar:
<font size="4"> This platform is extremely profitable, here is why: 
1. The cousulting market is rich and mature
2. A lot of consultants can work in their firms and on this platform at the same time, a blue ocean is beign created here, and whenver that happens, huge profit is expected.
3. This platform focues on revoultianizing (without disrupting) a fundemental aspect of business, everytime a next big thing happened, this was how.

The client achieved all these goals in clear mesurable metrics.

### The digital solution :chart: 
<font size="4">All this good planning would be useless without a good architecture, design, development and implementation.
We used python and django for the backend, communication was handeled with websockets, i used custom css and semantic html, unit testing
was an important aspect of the project. The Database was architectured in Postrgesql, and we hosted the platform in Heroku, serving client 
media from Amazon S3 Buckets.

<br/><br/>
### How we achieved our goal :tophat:
<font size="4">Our solution was implemented with these answers:

1. **Matching clients and couselors** : we created alerts and notifications everytime clients posted on the platform and counselors who are available and responsive are granted conversational priviliges with client, until the client  decides if the exchange was successfull or not.
2. **Communication** : A private conversation is created when a match occurs, the chat is maintained until the client ends it. 
3. **Client Satisfaction** : the client is considered served and compensated the moment he hits a validate button.
4. **Councelor compensation** : a balance is created, it keeps track of a councelor productivity and pays him accordinelly.
5. **Refund** : If an issue arises, a history of every interaction is available and will be consulted to judge the situation
