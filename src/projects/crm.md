### The problem :sos: 
<font size="4"> Managing without Saas is becoming nearly impossible in today's world, my client knew that. The client had an 
administration that was not centrelized, access rights were inexistant, there were no IT worrflow automation and reporting was
really random at some point, these issues among others needed to be solved immedialtly because competitors were already using
software as a service to adress these issues.
</font>
<br/><br/>
### Business profit and ROI :dollar:
<font size="4"> Here is how software as a service management will help the company: 
1. A centralized system to visualize and manage all company data in a categorized way
2. Control Points to check the compliance of the results of certain work in the business process
3. Access Control to restrict access to certain information and data based on user's credetentials
4. Workflow automation to keep processes running in reduced costs and error
5. Reporting, a central system of record

The client achieved all these goals in clear mesurable metrics

### The digital solution :chart: 
<font size="4"> I used technlogies like python, reactjs, django, tailwind.css, Postrgesql for database management and django 
rest framework to create a REST Api, consumed by axios in the react part, all endpoints were secure, and communication was fast and reliable.
</font>
<br/><br/>

### How we achieved our goal :tophat:
<font size="4">I created the following modules to solve the issue:

1. CRM: a client relational manager so that everybody can keep track of the business relation status
2. Sales: Information about sales made and failed, documents are being archived
3. Inventory: A database and database managemnt system tracks inventory changes along with providing predictions
4. Human Ressources: A system that keeps track of employees productivity
<br/>
I made logins and a registration system to guive employees access based on their roles, all actions are being tracked and recursive 
actions automated.
