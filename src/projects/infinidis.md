*Made with Python, Django, Bootstrap, Chart.js, django-qrcode, Google API and packaged with Docker :metal:*

### The problem :sos: 
<font size="4"> the client, a transportation and supply chain company, contacted me to digitilize their entire supply chain 
</font>
<br/><br/>
### Business profit and ROI :dollar:
<font size="4"> Digitilizing the supply chain will make profit for the client, here is how: 
1. Optimization: Digitilization of processes leaves no room for error
2. Speed: Digitilization will speed the process.
3. Management and vision: Digitiliaziion will guive the client data to leverage and interpret to enhance his process

The client achieved all these goals in clear mesurable metrics.

### The digital solution :chart: 
<font size="4"> The digital process created was :
1. **Client database entry**
2. **Plan a delivery to client**
3. **Generate QR Code**
4. **Generate PDF with QR Code**
5. **Print it and stick it on package to deliver**
6. **Transporter opens app and scans QR Code**
7. **Google maps shows itinerary**
8. **Change delivery status when package delivered (or not)**
</font>
<br/><br/>

### How we achieved our goal :tophat:
<font size="4">I used Python, Django, Docker and PostgreSql. I created the models necessary for the project, i made everything 
mobile friendly, and the design was super easy, a child could use the app (not recomended).
