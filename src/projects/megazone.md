### The problem :sos: 
<font size="4"> My client has started a business using just facebook and telegram. His business consisted of providing 
product images to followers he had on facebook and telegram groups, these followers get potential client info and share them 
with my client, who delivers to those potential clients. For each successful sale, the follower who leaded to it gets a commission.
This was fine up to a point where my client had up to 5000 followers, generating 800 potential sale each week. His business grew,
so he needs to grow with. I took the same business model he had and turned it into an online platform.
</font>
<br/><br/>
### Business profit and ROI :dollar:
<font size="4"> Making a platform for his business is profitable because: 
1. Organization: Data was all over the place, the tracking was nearly impossible, leads were getting lost.
2. Vision: The client lacked basic information about his business, who were the best salesman, what cities had more traction etc...
3. Management Insight: The client knew that he was losing money somehow, he found out that the returned products can't surpass a certain number, we helped him discover that number

The client achieved all these goals in clear mesurable metrics
</font>
<br/><br/>
### The digital solution :chart: 

<font size="4"> I used my usual tech stack: Python, Django, Javascript, Ajax, Postgresql, Docker and charts.js to create 
authentification and registration for salesman or droppers as the client calls them, then gave the clients a back and forth communication
with the client administration. Forms about new sales and delivery status were handy, charts to categorize data, by date and cities, 
the client had some serious business analytics at disposal.  
</font>
<br/><br/>
### How we achieved our goal :tophat:
<font size="4">The project went down this way:

1. Make a map of the actual business model  
2. Get metrics of where the client is right now sales wise
3. Architecture the database and models
4. Design and implementation 
5. Testing and debugging 
6. Hosting and maintenance
